# Alias.Action Scripts:

**General:**
Alias.Action scripts help the user type less to navigate the system faster with more control. Each Alias.Action command has a prefix that when used in combination with the tab key allows quick navigation and easy access to information. Alias.Action scripts are organized into groups and each group has a specific prefix in calling the command. Example using the cd.desktop navigation command:

cd.desktop

**Note:** After typing in "cd.d" you can press the tab key to have the rest of the alias.action command appear.

Example using the "set." prefix to load the Microsoft Settings "Lock Screen" options window:

set.lockscreen
